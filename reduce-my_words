[1,2,3,4,5].reduce(0, :+)
#for summation: arr.reduce(accumulator initialization, operation)

#under the hood
#first step: initialize sum to 0 
#summation of 0 and the first element: 0.+(1) => 1
#1st iteration: 1.+(2) => 3
#2nd iteration: 3.+(3) => 6
#3rd iteration: 6.+(4) => 10
#4th iteration: 10.+(5) => 15
#method automatically stops here and returns 15

#person might ask, "What is a symbol?"
#the symbol :+ is a symbolic link to the plus method of class Integer
	#as an aside, hash[key] == hash[:key]
	#the symbol :key points to its value, which is exactly what a key does
